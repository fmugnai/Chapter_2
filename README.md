The sampling location coordinates and metadata are available in the supplementary file 1 (Data_S1.csv).
All the new barcoded sequences used to build the COInr-Med+ database and submitted to GenBank (Accession numbers ON716004-ON716119), together with their taxonomic and geographic origins, are presented in the supplementary file 2 (Data_S2.csv).
The list of the ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) used in this study and obtained from Wangensteen et al., 2018, are available in the supplementary file 3 (Data_S3.csv).
In supplementary file 4 (Data_S4.csv), a list of Mediterranean marine families, obtained from OBIS (www.obis.org) restricting the search field to Mediterranean Sea LME (Large Marine Ecosystem), are listed.
A complete step-by-step guide about Perl commands used to create, customize, and format the desired reference databases are available in supplementary file 5 (Data_S5.html).
The number of taxonomic assignments for each resolution level (from unassigned to species) using four different taxonomic assignment methods (VTAM, QIIME_SKLEARN, QIIME_BLAST and RDP) and four different reference databases are available in supplementary file 6 (Data_S6.csv). The QIIME_BLAST algorithm was carried out using three different minimum identity thresholds (80%; 90% and 97%).
The taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the QIIME_BLAST algorithm with 97% identity cutoff and 4 different databases can be found in supplementary file 7 (Data_S7.csv).
The taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the QIIME_BLAST algorithm with 90% identity cutoff and 4 different databases is presented in supplementary file 8 (Data_S8.csv).
Supplementary data 9 includes the taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the QIIME_BLAST algorithm with 80% identity cutoff and 4 different databases (Data_S9.csv).
In supplementary file 10 you can find the taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the VTAM algorithm and 4 different databases (Data_S10.csv).
The taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the RDP algorithm and 4 different databases can be found in supplementary data 11 (Data_S11.csv). Only assignment with at least 70% bootstrap support were accepted.
In supplementary data 12, the taxonomic assignment of all ASVs using the QIIME_SKLEARN algorithm and 4 different databases is presented (Data_S12.csv). Only assignment with at least 70% support were accepted.
The pairwise comparison of the resolution of taxonomic assignments obtained by using two different databases is shown in supplementary data 13 (Data_S13.csv).
The taxonomic resolutions of ASVs using different similarity thresholds of QIIME 2 BLAST-based taxonomic assignment algorithm are shown in supplementary figure 1 (Figure_S1.pdf).
The detailed changes in taxonomic resolution between taxonomic assignments of two databases are presented in supplementary figure 2 (Figure_S2.pdf).
